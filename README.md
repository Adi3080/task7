# task7
This task focuses on creating and using SQL views to simplify complex queries and improve data security and abstraction.
The first view, named high_scorers, is created using a SELECT statement that filters students who have scored more than 80 marks. 
This helps in quickly accessing top-performing students without repeatedly writing the same query. 
The second view, department_avg_marks, calculates the average marks for each department by grouping the student records.
It is useful for analyzing departmental performance in a simplified and reusable manner. Both views were created and tested successfully in pgAdmin using PostgreSQL.
